## How to write
### Make diary file
You can automatically create folder & md file by `new.sh`
```
./new.sh [name]
```
example:
```
./new.sh HaeramKim
```
### Write metadata
Before writing diary, You have to write metadata first. Please follow the example below to know how to write it.
```
---
title: "My first diary"
date: "2022-01-05"
tags:
- "HaeramKim"
---
```
Please use `title` of metadata instead of `#` of markdown. And also, write your name in `tags` to identify the author.
But when you use `new.sh` to make diary file, metadata form will automatically generated and all you have to do is fill out the empty form.
